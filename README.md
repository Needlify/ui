## About Needlify

Needlify is a platform for sharing content and knowledge around IT and new technologies. Initially, this project was a proof of concept, however, as the development progressed, the idea materialized and it would be a shame to abandon the project. Our goal is to be able to offer a platform for sharing knowledge.

Needlify is already available in its original version. This repository aims to refurbish this project with new technologies.
